## Simple Receipe Searcher
To run this project, type node app on terminal, after that go to localhost:3000 on browser

Goal of the Project:
-to create a receipe searcher where everyone can use espcially during quarantine times to decrease the rate of infection while also making great food at home

Features of this Project:
-a search bar at the main page where you can search up different receipes
-using the Spoonacular Api to show the food after search
-the ability to store custom receipes in MongoDB 
-the ability to retrieve the custom receipes in MongoDB using the name of the dish ((check the checkbox on search bar))

Features to be implemented in future:
-to make the receipes actually pop up after searching instead of just pictures and names of the receipes
-a better looking website
-better interface on the custom receipes
-the ability to rate the receipes
-the ability to register accounts and login
